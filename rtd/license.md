# License

MinVar relies on some third-party tools with their own specific licenses.
It is worthy of note that recalibration is done by GATK, which is itself
subject to a dual purpose licensing: free for academic non-commercial research
activities, subject to a fee for commercial use.

The overall licensing of MinVar is then under definition.
