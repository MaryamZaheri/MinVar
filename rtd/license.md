# License

MinVar relies on some third-party tools with their own specific licenses.
It is worthy of note that recalibration is done by GATK, which is itself
subject to a dual purpose [licensing](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/licensing.php):
free for academic non-commercial research activities, subject to a fee for commercial use.

While you are free to use MinVar without restriction for research purposes, its
commercial licensing is under definition.
